Drawing on critical realist ontology while incorporating insights from Bourdieusian field theory, I propose a theoretical framework that transcends the traditional agency-structure dichotomy by reconceptualizing agency as emergent from, yet irreducible to, structural conditions. This approach offers analytical advantages over both methodological individualism and structural determinism, as I will demonstrate through a critical examination of three influential studies in the educational mobility literature.\"",

I acknowledge that integrating quantitative network analysis with interpretive ethnographic methods creates tensions, particularly regarding how we conceptualize causality. However, rather than viewing this as a fundamental incompatibility, we've approached it as a productive tension that allows us to illuminate different dimensions of the phenomenon. The network analysis identifies structural patterns that would remain invisible to ethnographic observation alone, while the ethnographic component provides depth and context that gives meaning to those patterns. That said, your point about the potential incommensurability of the validity claims across these methods is well-taken, and in the full paper, we address this more explicitly in our discussion of methodological limitations.\"",

Namun, alih-alih memandangnya sebagai ketidakcocokan fundamental, kami mendekatinya sebagai ketegangan produktif yang memungkinkan kami untuk menerangi dimensi fenomena yang berbeda. Analisis jaringan mengidentifikasi pola struktural yang akan tetap tidak terlihat bagi pengamatan etnografi saja, sementara komponen etnografi memberikan kedalaman dan konteks yang memberi makna pada pola-pola tersebut.

This concept helps us move beyond both techno-deterministic accounts that overstate algorithmic power and voluntaristic perspectives that overemphasize user agency. Instead, it directs our attention to the co-constitutive processes through which both algorithms and human subjects are continuously reconfigured through their interactions. This framework might help reconcile the seemingly contradictory empirical findings presented earlier, as it suggests that algorithmic effects are neither uniform nor predetermined, but rather contingent upon specific socio-technical configurations and the evolving forms of subjectivity they engender.\"",

Konsep ini membantu kita bergerak melampaui baik akun tekno-deterministik yang melebih-lebihkan kekuatan algoritmik maupun perspektif voluntaristik yang terlalu menekankan agensi pengguna. Sebaliknya, ini mengarahkan perhatian kita pada proses ko-konstitutif di mana baik algoritma maupun subjek manusia terus dikonfigurasi ulang melalui interaksi mereka. Kerangka ini mungkin membantu mendamaikan temuan empiris yang tampaknya kontradiktif yang disajikan sebelumnya, karena menunjukkan bahwa efek algoritmik tidak seragam atau telah ditentukan sebelumnya, tetapi lebih bergantung pada konfigurasi sosio-teknis spesifik dan bentuk-bentuk subjektivitas yang berkembang yang mereka hasilkan.\""

Unlike purely constructivist approaches, we maintain that some explanatory accounts more adequately represent underlying causal processes than others, while acknowledging that all knowledge claims are fallible and open to revision.

Our approach involves three integrated components: first, technical analysis of algorithmic systems through code audits and reverse engineering; second, participant observation of user interactions with these systems in natural settings; and third, reflexive experimentation where researchers systematically vary their own interactions to observe algorithmic responses. This methodology addresses the challenge of studying sociotechnical systems where key actors (algorithms) are not directly observable through conventional means, while maintaining ethnography's commitment to understanding lived experience and meaning-making.\"",

      text: `# Abstract 1: "Reconceptualizing Agency in Digital Environments: A Post-Humanist Perspective"

This article challenges conventional humanist conceptualizations of agency that privilege human intentionality and autonomy, proposing instead a post-humanist framework for understanding agency in digital environments as distributed across heterogeneous networks of human and non-human actors. Drawing on actor-network theory and new materialist perspectives, I argue that digital technologies do not merely mediate human agency but actively constitute new forms of distributed agency through their algorithmic operations, material affordances, and emergent properties. Through a multi-sited ethnographic study of three algorithmic systemsâ€”a content recommendation engine, an automated hiring platform, and a predictive policing applicationâ€”I demonstrate how agency emerges through complex socio-technical assemblages rather than residing in either human subjects or technological objects. This reconceptualization has significant implications for questions of responsibility, accountability, and ethics in digital societies, suggesting the need for new theoretical and methodological approaches that can account for the entangled nature of human and technological agency without collapsing into either technological determinism or human exceptionalism. The article concludes by proposing a relational ethics of distributed agency that acknowledges the asymmetrical power relations within socio-technical networks while avoiding both the abdication of human responsibility and the reinscription of humanist assumptions about autonomous subjectivity.

# Abstract 2: "Human Agency in the Age of Algorithms: Defending a Capabilities Approach"

This article argues for a robust defense of human agency in the face of increasingly pervasive algorithmic systems, developing a normative framework grounded in the capabilities approach. Against post-humanist accounts that dissolve the distinction between human and technological agency, I maintain that preserving a meaningful concept of human agency is essential for addressing the ethical and political challenges posed by digital technologies. Through critical analysis of contemporary algorithmic systems in three domainsâ€”social media, healthcare, and criminal justiceâ€”I demonstrate how these technologies can both enhance and undermine human capabilities for reasoned self-determination. Drawing on empirical research and philosophical analysis, I identify five key capabilities necessary for meaningful agency in algorithmic environments: informational self-determination, critical algorithmic literacy, effective contestation, collective governance, and technological reversibility. The article develops a mixed-methods approach combining institutional analysis, phenomenological investigation, and normative argumentation to examine how these capabilities are distributed across different social contexts and subject positions. Rather than conceptualizing agency as either entirely autonomous or fully determined, I propose understanding it as relationally constituted but irreducible to its socio-technical conditions. This approach offers conceptual resources for designing and governing algorithmic systems in ways that enhance rather than diminish human capabilities for self-determination and collective action.

# Abstract 3: "Beyond the Human/Technology Binary: Toward a Symmetrical Ontology of Agency"

This article develops a symmetrical ontology of agency that transcends the persistent binary between human and technological agency dominating both scholarly and public discourse on digital technologies. Drawing on process philosophy, science and technology studies, and indigenous ontologies, I argue that agency is neither a property that entities possess nor a capacity exercised by pre-existing subjects, but rather an emergent phenomenon constituted through ongoing processes of intra-action within socio-material assemblages. Through comparative analysis of three case studiesâ€”environmental sensing networks, machine learning systems in scientific discovery, and digital activism platformsâ€”I demonstrate how different configurations of human and non-human elements enable and constrain particular forms of agency without privileging either human intentionality or technological causality as ontologically prior. Methodologically, the research employs a novel combination of computational network analysis, qualitative fieldwork, and philosophical inquiry to trace how agency materializes across diverse socio-technical arrangements. This symmetrical approach reveals how conventional humanist and instrumentalist frameworks systematically obscure the complex ways that agencies are constituted, distributed, and transformed in digital environments. The article concludes by exploring the ethical and political implications of this ontological reframing, suggesting that it opens new possibilities for responsible innovation and democratic governance beyond both techno-optimist and techno-pessimist positions that remain trapped within the human/technology binary.`,

"Reconceptualizing Methodological Nationalism: Toward a Transnational Epistemology of Migration

Good afternoon. In this presentation, I will introduce the concept of 'methodological transnationalism' as an alternative epistemological framework for migration studies, addressing the persistent limitations of methodological nationalism that continue to shape research design and theoretical development in the field.

As scholars have long recognized, methodological nationalismâ€”the tendency to treat the nation-state as the natural container for social processesâ€”has profoundly constrained our understanding of human mobility. While this critique is now well-established, I argue that existing alternatives remain inadequate for three reasons: First, they often replace nation-centric frameworks with other container models, merely shifting the unit of analysis without challenging container thinking itself. Second, they frequently retain implicit assumptions about territorial boundedness even while explicitly rejecting methodological nationalism. And third, they tend to privilege mobility over emplacement, creating a new binary rather than transcending the mobility/immobility dichotomy.

Drawing on three years of multi-sited ethnographic research with transnational families spanning Ecuador, the United States, and Spain, I develop an alternative epistemological framework that conceptualizes migration not as movement between discrete national containers but as constitutive of social fields that simultaneously transcend and are shaped by national boundaries. This approach reveals how migrants navigate multiple regulatory regimes, construct transnational care arrangements, and develop complex identities that cannot be adequately captured through methodologically nationalist perspectives.

The significance of this reconceptualization extends beyond migration studies to address fundamental questions about how we understand social processes in an interconnected world. By denaturalizing the nation-state as the primary unit of analysis without dismissing its continuing importance in shaping social reality, methodological transnationalism offers conceptual tools for examining how social phenomena are simultaneously deterritorialized and reterritorialized through complex global processes.

In the remainder of this presentation, I will elaborate the key dimensions of this framework, demonstrate its application through empirical cases from my research, address potential critiques, and suggest directions for future theoretical and methodological development."`,
