    title: 'Advanced Passive Structures',
    description: 'Master complex passive constructions for academic and professional contexts',
    content: `At the C1 level, you should be able to use advanced passive structures with precision and flexibility. These structures are particularly important in academic writing, formal reports, and professional communication.

Advanced passive constructions go beyond the basic "subject + be + past participle" structure and include:

1. Passive Infinitives:
   - "The report is expected to be completed by next week."
   - "The changes need to be implemented immediately."

2. Passive Gerunds:
   - "She doesn't appreciate being interrupted during meetings."
   - "The company denied having been informed about the issue."

3. Passive with Modal Verbs:
   - "The proposal should have been submitted last month."
   - "This error could have been avoided with proper planning."

4. Passive Reporting Structures:
   - "The minister is thought to have resigned due to the scandal."
   - "The company is rumored to be facing bankruptcy."

5. Passive Causative Forms:
   - "They had the report written by an external consultant."
   - "We're having our website redesigned by a professional agency."

When to use advanced passive structures:
- To emphasize the action rather than the agent
- When the agent is unknown, unimportant, or obvious
- To create an objective, impersonal tone in academic or scientific writing
- To avoid assigning direct responsibility or blame
- To maintain a formal register in professional communication

Remember that overusing passive voice can make your writing seem vague or evasive. Use these structures purposefully and strategically to enhance your communication.`,

    title: 'Mixed Conditionals and Hypothetical Situations',
    description: 'Express complex hypothetical situations and nuanced conditions',
    content: `At the C1 level, you should be able to express complex hypothetical situations using mixed conditionals and other advanced conditional structures. These allow you to communicate sophisticated ideas about unreal situations in the past, present, and future.

Mixed conditionals combine different time references between the condition (if clause) and the result. They're used to express complex relationships between hypothetical situations across different time periods.

1. Past Condition → Present Result:
   - "If I had studied medicine (past condition), I would be a doctor now (present result)."
   - "If they hadn't invested in that company (past condition), they wouldn't be facing financial difficulties now (present result)."

2. Present Condition → Past Result:
   - "If I were more qualified (present condition), I would have applied for the position (past result)."
   - "If she spoke French (present condition), she would have accepted the job in Paris (past result)."

3. Inverted Conditionals (without 'if'):
   - "Had I known about the meeting, I would have prepared a presentation." (= If I had known...)
   - "Were he to resign, the company would face a leadership crisis." (= If he were to resign...)

4. Advanced Conditional Phrases:
   - "But for the rain, the event would have been a success." (= If it hadn't been for the rain...)
   - "Supposing you were offered the position, would you accept it?"
   - "On condition that all parties agree, we can proceed with the project."

5. Conditionals with Modal Perfects:
   - "If you had followed the instructions, you might not have made that mistake."
   - "Even if they had arrived on time, they could not have prevented the accident."

These structures allow you to express nuanced hypothetical reasoning, regrets about the past, and complex cause-effect relationships across different time frames.`,

    title: 'Academic Vocabulary and Nominalisation',
    description: 'Enhance your formal writing with sophisticated vocabulary and nominalisation techniques',
    content: `At the C1 level, you should be able to use academic vocabulary and nominalisation effectively to create formal, concise, and sophisticated written and spoken discourse.

Nominalisation is the process of converting verbs, adjectives, or clauses into nouns or noun phrases. This technique is particularly valued in academic and professional writing because it:

1. Creates a more formal, objective tone
2. Allows for more concise expression of complex ideas
3. Helps maintain cohesion in text by referring back to previous ideas
4. Enables precise discussion of abstract concepts

Examples of nominalisation:
- Verb to noun: analyze → analysis, develop → development, conclude → conclusion
- Adjective to noun: different → difference, significant → significance, possible → possibility
- Clause to noun phrase: "They failed" → "Their failure"

Academic vocabulary features:
- Precise terminology specific to your field
- Formal alternatives to common words (e.g., "investigate" instead of "look into")
- Latin and Greek-derived words (e.g., "facilitate" instead of "help")
- Objective, impersonal language (avoiding "I think" or "in my opinion")
- Hedging language to express appropriate caution (e.g., "appears to suggest," "may indicate")

Common academic collocations:
- conduct research, draw conclusions, gather evidence
- significant findings, compelling argument, rigorous methodology
- critically analyze, thoroughly examine, carefully consider

When using academic vocabulary and nominalisation:
- Ensure precision and accuracy in your word choice
- Maintain clarity—don't use complex language just to sound impressive
- Balance nominalised structures with active constructions to maintain readability
- Be aware of your audience and adjust your language accordingly`,

    title: 'Advanced Discourse Markers and Cohesive Devices',
    description: 'Create sophisticated, cohesive arguments using advanced linking expressions',
    content: `At the C1 level, you should be able to use a wide range of discourse markers and cohesive devices to create sophisticated, well-structured arguments and narratives.

Discourse markers are words and phrases that connect ideas and guide the reader or listener through your text. Advanced discourse markers allow you to express complex relationships between ideas with precision and nuance.

1. Advanced Sequencing and Structuring:
   - "In the first instance..." / "Primarily..." (introducing first points)
   - "Subsequently..." / "Following this..." (continuing points)
   - "To conclude..." / "In summary..." (concluding points)

2. Expressing Complex Cause and Effect:
   - "As a consequence of..." / "Owing to..." / "Stemming from..."
   - "This gives rise to..." / "This precipitates..." / "This engenders..."
   - "The ramifications/implications of this are..."

3. Sophisticated Contrast and Concession:
   - "Notwithstanding..." / "Despite the fact that..." / "In spite of..."
   - "Conversely..." / "On the contrary..." / "In stark contrast..."
   - "Although this may be true, it should be acknowledged that..."

4. Nuanced Addition and Elaboration:
   - "Furthermore..." / "Moreover..." / "In addition to this..."
   - "Not only...but also..." / "As well as..." / "Besides..."
   - "To elaborate further..." / "To expand on this point..."

5. Subtle Emphasis and Exemplification:
   - "Particularly..." / "Notably..." / "Significantly..."
   - "A case in point..." / "To illustrate this..." / "As exemplified by..."
   - "It is worth highlighting that..." / "Of particular importance is..."

6. Sophisticated Reformulation:
   - "In other words..." / "That is to say..." / "To put it another way..."
   - "To rephrase this..." / "This can be interpreted as..."
   - "What this suggests is..." / "This can be understood as..."

Using these advanced discourse markers effectively requires:
- Understanding the precise meaning and connotations of each marker
- Selecting markers that accurately reflect the relationship between ideas
- Using a variety of markers to avoid repetition
- Ensuring the marker is appropriate for the register and context

Remember that overusing discourse markers can make your writing seem mechanical or formulaic. Use them purposefully to guide your reader through complex arguments and ideas.`,

    title: 'Critical Analysis and Argumentation',
    description: 'Develop sophisticated critical thinking and persuasive argumentation skills',
    content: `At the C1 level, you should be able to construct sophisticated arguments, critically analyze complex texts, and engage with abstract ideas in both written and spoken English.

Critical analysis involves examining ideas, evidence, and arguments to form reasoned judgments. It requires you to go beyond surface understanding to evaluate the quality, validity, and significance of information.

Key components of advanced critical analysis:

1. Evaluating Evidence and Sources:
   - Assessing the credibility, reliability, and potential bias of sources
   - Distinguishing between fact, opinion, and reasoned judgment
   - Identifying logical fallacies and flawed reasoning
   - Recognizing when evidence is sufficient, relevant, and representative

2. Constructing Sophisticated Arguments:
   - Developing clear, precise thesis statements
   - Supporting claims with appropriate evidence and reasoning
   - Anticipating and addressing counterarguments
   - Using qualified language to acknowledge limitations and nuance

3. Analyzing Rhetorical Strategies:
   - Identifying persuasive techniques in others' arguments
   - Recognizing emotional appeals, ethical appeals, and logical appeals
   - Understanding how context and audience shape communication
   - Evaluating the effectiveness of different rhetorical approaches

4. Synthesizing Multiple Perspectives:
   - Integrating ideas from diverse sources and viewpoints
   - Identifying patterns, connections, and contradictions across texts
   - Developing new insights through the combination of existing ideas
   - Recognizing the complexity of issues and avoiding oversimplification

Language for Critical Analysis:
- Evaluative language: "compelling," "unconvincing," "well-supported," "problematic"
- Analytical verbs: "suggests," "implies," "demonstrates," "contradicts"
- Hedging language: "appears to," "tends to," "may indicate," "to some extent"
- Concessive language: "while," "although," "despite," "nevertheless"

Remember that effective critical analysis is not about being negative or finding fault, but about thoughtful, balanced evaluation that acknowledges both strengths and limitations.`,
